Don't come to me for your problems, If you have a problem. READ the FAQ, don't bother me.


The entire game Is in a different language? 

Well, If you don't know english. Then sfp.archive might not be of use to you, I only cover english. 
However, in external-sources you can find the link to steamdb.info. I they give out the code based on regions, 
I'd go there if i were you.




One of my games that was playable is no longer in my library? What do I do?

Most likely, the game was in it's open beta stages. Once an open-beta game has been fully released the developers will revoke
your access and make you play for the same game. 



One of the games I got won't let me play after a while?


You are probably playing a DEMO, you'd have to pay for the full game to fully enjoy gameplay.

FYI, if a game says "DEMO" on the list then It is NOT the full game.

My game's weren't added to my steam library? What do I do? 

Then most likely you didn't follow the steps, read and FOLLOW the instructions.
